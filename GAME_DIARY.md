Initial Centauri scaffold: Vite, TypeScript, Three.js, Playwright demo artifact workflow, Symphony instructions, and a first deterministic alien-planet flythrough.

Cleaned up generated media handling: demo screenshots/videos are produced by Playwright and uploaded as workflow artifacts, but ignored by Git and not committed to the repository.

Made the sky more alien: a pink-blue-to-purple gradient dome, many visible moons and ringed bodies, and a slightly higher PR demo gaze so the new sky reads in review captures.

Added alien nature density: readable low-poly trees, small glowing ground sprouts, spring pools, and a central glassy stream placed along the deterministic PR flythrough.

Tightened the alien tree silhouettes so the trunks, collars, and canopies overlap as one readable form instead of looking like disconnected stacked pieces.

Reworked the alien trees again with centered, overlapping crowns around a trunk that visibly rises into the canopy to avoid a disjointed stacked read.

Changed pools and the stream into terrain-following water meshes so the demo water sits against the ground instead of floating over uneven terrain.

Added lightweight first-person collision against alien trees and larger rocks using explicit circular blockers while keeping water, sprouts, and small glowing flora passable.

Flattened the planet's visual language toward broad Proteus-like graphic masses: unlit world materials, muted flora and stone colors, banded terrain/sky color, lower-resolution pixel edges, and a closer PR demo path for reading silhouettes.
